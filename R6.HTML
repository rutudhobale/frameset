    Football is a family of team sports that involve,<br> to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.<br> Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is <br>the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football <br>(known as soccer in North America and Oceania); gridiron football <br>(specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football;<br> rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football.<br> These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as football codes.<br>

    There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball<br> games played in many different parts of the world.<br> Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at <br>English public schools during the 19th century.<br> The expansion and cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football<br> to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire.<br> By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing:<br> Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional<br> football games in order to maintain their heritage.<br> In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football associations.<br> During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the<br> most popular team sports in the world.
