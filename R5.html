    Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net.<BR>Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles"<BR>(with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side).<BR> Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach;<BR> formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. <BR>Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing<BR> it within the opposing side's half of the court.<BR>

    Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net.<BR> Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault<BR> has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side.<BR>
    
    The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic<BR> projectile which flies differently from the balls used in many other sports.<BR> In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, <BR>causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly.<BR> Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls <BR>in other racquet sports. The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature.<BR>
    
    The game developed in British India from the earlier <BR>game of battledore and shuttlecock. European play came to be dominated <BR>by Denmark but the game has become very popular in Asia,<BR> with recent competitions dominated by China.
