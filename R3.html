    Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players<br> each on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre)<br> pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. <br>The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the bowler, "bowls" (propels)<br> the ball from one end of the pitch towards the wicket at the other end, with an "over" <br>being completed once they have legally done so six times. <br>The batting side has one player at each end of the pitch,<br> with the player at the opposite end of the pitch from the bowler aiming to strike the ball with a bat.<br> The batting side scores runs either when the ball reaches the boundary of the field,<br> or when the two batters swap ends of the pitch, which results in one run. <br>The fielding side's aim is to prevent run-scoring and dismiss each batter <br>(so they are "out", and are said to have "lost their wicket").<br> Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the bowled<br> ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side <br>either catching a hit ball before it touches the ground, or hitting a wicket with<br> the ball before a batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket to complete a run.<br> When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. <br>The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches.
