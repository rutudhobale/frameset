    Hockey is a term used to denote various types of both summer and winter<br> team sports which originated on either an outdoor field, <br>sheet of ice, or dry floor such as in a gymnasium.<br>

There are many types of hockey. Some games make the use of skates,<br> either wheeled, or bladed while others do not.<br> In order to help make the distinction between these various games,<br> the word "hockey" is often<br> preceeded by another word i.e. "field hockey", "ice hockey", "roller hockey", "rink hockey", or "floor hockey".<br>

In each of these sports, two teams play against each other by<br> trying to manoeuvre the object of play, either a type of ball or a disk (such as a puck), <br>into the opponent's goal using a hockey stick.<br> Two notable exceptions use a straight stick and an open disk<br>(still referred to as a "puck") with a hole in the center instead. <br>The first case is a style of floor hockey whose rules were codified in 1936<br> during the Great Depression by Canada's Sam Jacks.<br> The second case involves a variant which was later modified in <br>roughly the 1970's to make a related game that would be considered<br> suitable for inclusion as a team sport in the newly emerging Special Olympics.
